Description,"Identification number of the sample. This is the fundamental unit of sampling the tissue (the specimen taken from the subject), which can be the same as the 'subject_ID', but is often different if multiple samples are taken from the same subject. Note: this is NOT a unit of multiplexing of donor samples, which should be stored in ""library"".",This text describes and differentiates the dataset from other datasets in the same collection. It is strongly recommended that each dataset title in a collection is unique and does not depend on other metadata such as a different assay to disambiguate it from other datasets in the collection.,The DOI of the associated paper (if there is one),This must be free-text that identifies a unique individual that data were derived from.,"The protocols.io URL (if none exists, please use the BioRxiv URL) for the full experimental protocol; or if multiple protocols exist please list them e.g. sample preparation protocol / sequencing protocol.",Institution where the samples were processed.,The email of a contact person for the dataset.

This field is only needed if multiple samples from the same subject are available and collected at different time points. Sample collection dates (e.g. 23/09/22) cannot be used due to patient data protection, only relative time points should be used here (e.g. day3).",The unique ID that is used to track libraries in the investigator's institution (should align with the publication).,"The unique ID used to track libraries from one of the following public data repositories: EGAX*, GSM*, SRX*, ERX*",Encoding of author knowledge on any further information related to likely batch effects.,"The name given to the type of organism, collected in NCBITaxon:0000 format.","Manner of death classification based on the Hardy Scale or 'unknown' or 'not applicable':

Category 2 = Fast death of natural causes  -Sudden unexpected deaths of people who had been reasonably healthy, after a terminal phase estimated at < 1 hr (with sudden death from a myocardial infarction as a model cause of death for this category) 
Category 3 = Intermediate death - Death after a terminal phase of 1 to 24 hrs (not classifiable as 2 or 4); patients who were ill but death was unexpected 
Category 4 = Slow death - Death after a long illness, with a terminal phase longer than 1 day (commonly cancer or chronic pulmonary disease); deaths that are not unexpected 
Category 0 =Ventilator Case - All cases on a ventilator immediately before death
